# AI-Powered Sales Recommendation Tool

## Overview

This project is an interactive website for bank Relationship Managers (RMs) to receive AI-powered recommendations for the next best products to sell to corporate customers. The tool also generates conversation starters by analyzing customer data and market trends.

## Features

*   **Customer Search:** RMs can search for corporate customers by name.
*   **Customer Profile:** The tool displays a detailed profile for each customer, including:
    *   Company Name
    *   Company Size
    *   Revenue (last 3 years)
    *   Recent Transactions
*   **AI Recommendations:** A "Generate Next Best Action" button provides:
    *   Recommended products to pitch.
    *   A conversation starter based on the customer's activity and market trends.

## Design

*   **Theme:** Sleek and modern, adhering to the DBS Bank color theme (red and black).
*   **Layout:** Clean and intuitive, with a focus on user experience.
*   **Typography:** Clear and legible, with a professional tone.

## Project Structure

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file.
*   `style.css`: The CSS file for styling.
*   `main.js`: The JavaScript file for application logic and data.

## Current Plan

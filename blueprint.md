# AI-Powered Sales Recommendation Tool

## Features

*   **Customer Search:** RMs can search for corporate customers by name.
*   **Customer Profile:** The tool displays a detailed profile for each customer, including:
    *   Company Name
    *   Company Size
    *   Revenue (last 3 years) with a visual chart.
    *   Recent Transactions
*   **AI Recommendations:** A "Generate Next Best Action" button provides:
    *   Recommended products to pitch with an icon.
    *   A conversation starter based on the customer's activity and market trends with an icon.

## Design

*   **Theme:** Sleek and modern, adhering to the DBS Bank color theme (red and black).
*   **Layout:** Clean and intuitive, with a focus on user experience.
*   **Typography:** Clear and legible, with a professional tone.
*   **Iconography:** Using Font Awesome for clear visual cues.

## Project Structure

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file.

3.  **Add Icons:** Use Font Awesome to add icons to the recommendation and conversation starter sections.
4.  **Refine Styles:** Adjust CSS for the new elements to ensure a cohesive design.
5.  **Review and Refine:** Test the application thoroughly and make any necessary improvements.
